- [x] `lrparser.py` compile with mypyc - it is converted to mypyc compiled. Even then there is no improvement in the memory usage
- [x] Try pickling LRParser ext. instance directly and see whether loading it back improves the memory usage. -- The generated table is simply large.
- [x] rewrite the particular module in rust -- Even the table represented in rust is fairly above 5MB
- [x] Lark's LALR implementation is as fast as ply but uses small cache. we can try to port it to ply
- [ ] check pegen implementation and test a small xonsh grammar addition to it
- [ ] post Lark's SPPF implementation to ply - cehckout https://github.com/lark-parser/lark_cython/
- [ ] check LALRPOP's lane table implementation and see if we can port it to ply-yacc
